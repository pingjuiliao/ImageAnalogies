# Image Analogies
### A: A' = B: B'
Capture the relationship between image A and image A' and then synthesize a picture B'
This is a re-implementation of the paper [Image Analygies](https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/publications/image-analogies/analogies-72dpi.pdf)

Instead of just re-mapping pixels. We need to break the image into low-resolution and calculate the geometric means to build it back to the original resolution.

## Usage
```
# This will read from one of the directoies
./main.py rock
```
